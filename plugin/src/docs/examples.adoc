==== grails-spring-security-group
A sample Grails App which uses the Spring Security Core Plugin and Group Authentication as described in the documentation.

Rather than granting authorities directly to a “person”, you can create a “group”, map authorities to it, and then map a “person” to that “group”. For applications that have a one or more groups of users who need the same level of access, having one or more “group” instances makes managing changes to access levels easier.

==== grails-spring-security-hierarchical-roles
A sample Grails App which uses the Spring Security Core Plugin and Hierarchical Roles as described in the documentation.
